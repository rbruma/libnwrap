*** examples/README

This directory contains some examples of using libnwrap. 

All the source files here should be compiled and linked with -lnwrap amd -lpthread

Currently there are:

* simple.c     : the most trivial TCP server I can think of, but illustrates
                 a lot about the functionality that libnwrap provides
* echosrv.c    : a simple protocol-independent implementation of a TCP & UDP 
                 echo server [RFC 862, Postel, May 1983]
* discardsrv.c : a simple but protocol independent implementation of the 
                 discard protocol [RFC 863, Postel, May 1993]
* daytimesrv.c : a protocol independent daytime server

* daytimeudpcli.c : a trivial daytime udp client

* webcli.c : a more complex example, simulating a web client which performs
             resource retrieval using simultaneous connections; almost a 
             "real-world" example
